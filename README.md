# FoodZen
- An android app that lets users scan grocery bills and find recipes based on the purchased 
ingredients. 

- Developed with **Kotlin** and **XML** and follows MVVM architecture.

- Uses Optical Character Recognition (**OCR**) to detect text from images and Named Entity 
Recognition (**NER**) to detect ingredients from text.
 
- Uses **retrofit** to fetch food recipes from **API** and **room database** for saving favorite recipes. 

- Users can also manage a shopping list, filer recipes, save recipes and share recipe cards and 
links.
